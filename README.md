A ragbag of scripts. All are licensed CC Zero.

* harmonize_genre_tag.py is a script to run on a music collection (flac/mp3) in
  order to revise the genre metadata on an artist/album basis. You are asked
  once per artist (optionally per album) what genre to assign. The script
  remembers your most used values and gives easy access to re-use them later.
